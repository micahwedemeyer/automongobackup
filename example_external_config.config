# Documentation
#=====================================================================
# Set DBUSERNAME and DBPASSWORD of a user that has at least SELECT permission
# to ALL databases.
#
# Set the DBHOST option to the server you wish to backup, leave the
# default to backup "this server".(to backup multiple servers make
# copies of this file and set the options for that server)
#
# You can change the backup storage location from /backups to anything
# you like by using the BACKUPDIR setting..
#
# The MAILCONTENT and MAILADDR options and pretty self explanatory, use
# these to have the backup log mailed to you at any email address or multiple
# email addresses in a space seperated list.
#
# (If you set mail content to "log" you will require access to the "mail" program
# on your server. If you set this to "files" you will have to have mutt installed
# on your server. If you set it to "stdout" it will log to the screen if run from
# the console or to the cron job owner if run through cron. If you set it to "quiet"
# logs will only be mailed if there are errors reported. )
#
#
# Finally copy automongobackup.sh to anywhere on your server and make sure
# to set executable permission. You can also copy the script to
# /etc/cron.daily to have it execute automatically every night or simply
# place a symlink in /etc/cron.daily to the file if you wish to keep it
# somwhere else.
#
# NOTE: On Debian copy the file with no extention for it to be run
# by cron e.g just name the file "automongobackup"
#
# Thats it..
#
#
# === Advanced options ===
#
# To set the day of the week that you would like the weekly backup to happen
# set the WEEKLYDAY setting, this can be a value from 1 to 7 where 1 is Monday,
# The default is 6 which means that weekly backups are done on a Saturday.
#
# Use PREBACKUP and POSTBACKUP to specify Pre and Post backup commands
# or scripts to perform tasks either before or after the backup process.
#
#
#=====================================================================
# Backup Rotation..
#=====================================================================
#
# Daily backups are executed if DODAILY is set to "yes".
# The number of daily backup copies to keep for each day (i.e. 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.) is set with DAILYRETENTION.
# DAILYRETENTION=0 rotates daily backups every week (i.e. only the most recent daily copy is kept). -1 disables rotation.
#
# Weekly backups are executed if DOWEEKLY is set to "yes".
# WEEKLYDAY [1-7] sets which day a weekly backup occurs when cron.daily scripts are run.
# Rotate weekly copies after the number of weeks set by WEEKLYRETENTION.
# WEEKLYRETENTION=0 rotates weekly backups every week. -1 disables rotation.
#
# Monthly backups are executed if DOMONTHLY is set to "yes".
# Monthy backups occur on the first day of each month when cron.daily scripts are run.
# Rotate monthly backups after the number of months set by MONTHLYRETENTION.
# MONTHLYRETENTION=0 rotates monthly backups upon each execution. -1 disables rotation.
