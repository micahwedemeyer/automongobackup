#=====================================================================
#=====================================================================
# Set the following variables to your system needs
# (Detailed instructions below variables)
#=====================================================================

# Username to access the mongo server e.g. dbuser
# Unnecessary if authentication is off
# DBUSERNAME=""

# Username to access the mongo server e.g. password
# Unnecessary if authentication is off
# DBPASSWORD=""

# Host name (or IP address) of mongo server e.g localhost
DBHOST="127.0.0.1"

# Port that mongo is listening on
DBPORT="27017"

# Backup directory location e.g /backups
BACKUPDIR="/var/backups/mongodb"

# Mail setup
# What would you like to be mailed to you?
# - log   : send only log file
# - files : send log file and sql files as attachments (see docs)
# - stdout : will simply output the log to the screen if run manually.
# - quiet : Only send logs if an error occurs to the MAILADDR.
MAILCONTENT="stdout"

# Set the maximum allowed email size in k. (4000 = approx 5MB email [see docs])
MAXATTSIZE="4000"

# Email Address to send mail to? (user@domain.com)
# MAILADDR=""

# ============================================================
# === ADVANCED OPTIONS ( Read the doc's below for details )===
#=============================================================

# Which day do you want weekly backups? (1 to 7 where 1 is Monday)
DOWEEKLY=6

# Choose Compression type. (gzip or bzip2)
COMP="gzip"

# Choose if the uncompressed folder should be deleted after compression has completed
CLEANUP="yes"

# Additionally keep a copy of the most recent backup in a seperate directory.
LATEST="yes"

# Make Hardlink not a copy
LATESTLINK="yes"

# Use oplog for point-in-time snapshotting.
OPLOG="yes"

# Choose other Server if is Replica-Set Master
REPLICAONSLAVE="yes"

# Command to run before backups (uncomment to use)
# PREBACKUP=""

# Command run after backups (uncomment to use)
# POSTBACKUP=""

#=====================================================================
# Options documentation
#=====================================================================
# Set DBUSERNAME and DBPASSWORD of a user that has at least SELECT permission
# to ALL databases.
#
# Set the DBHOST option to the server you wish to backup, leave the
# default to backup "this server".(to backup multiple servers make
# copies of this file and set the options for that server)
#
# You can change the backup storage location from /backups to anything
# you like by using the BACKUPDIR setting..
#
# The MAILCONTENT and MAILADDR options and pretty self explanatory, use
# these to have the backup log mailed to you at any email address or multiple
# email addresses in a space seperated list.
#
# (If you set mail content to "log" you will require access to the "mail" program
# on your server. If you set this to "files" you will have to have mutt installed
# on your server. If you set it to "stdout" it will log to the screen if run from
# the console or to the cron job owner if run through cron. If you set it to "quiet"
# logs will only be mailed if there are errors reported. )
#
#
# Finally copy automongobackup.sh to anywhere on your server and make sure
# to set executable permission. You can also copy the script to
# /etc/cron.daily to have it execute automatically every night or simply
# place a symlink in /etc/cron.daily to the file if you wish to keep it
# somwhere else.
#
# NOTE: On Debian copy the file with no extention for it to be run
# by cron e.g just name the file "automongobackup"
#
# Thats it..
#
#
# === Advanced options ===
#
# To set the day of the week that you would like the weekly backup to happen
# set the DOWEEKLY setting, this can be a value from 1 to 7 where 1 is Monday,
# The default is 6 which means that weekly backups are done on a Saturday.
#
# Use PREBACKUP and POSTBACKUP to specify Pre and Post backup commands
# or scripts to perform tasks either before or after the backup process.
#
#
#=====================================================================
# Backup Rotation..
#=====================================================================
#
# Daily Backups are rotated weekly.
#
# Weekly Backups are run by default on Saturday Morning when
# cron.daily scripts are run. This can be changed with DOWEEKLY setting.
#
# Weekly Backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle.
# Monthly Backups are run on the 1st of the month.
# Monthly Backups are NOT rotated automatically.
#
# It may be a good idea to copy Monthly backups offline or to another
# server.
#
#=====================================================================
# Please Note!!
#=====================================================================
#
# I take no resposibility for any data loss or corruption when using
# this script.
#
# This script will not help in the event of a hard drive crash. You
# should copy your backups offline or to another PC for best protection.
#
# Happy backing up!
